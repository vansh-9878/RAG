Raw response from Gemini: ["The document indicates that criminal law, including matters in the Indian Penal Code, covers offenses. Theft of a car would fall under criminal law.", "The document states that any arrested person must be informed of the grounds for arrest and produced before a magistrate within twenty-four hours, and cannot be detained beyond that period without a magistrate's authority. It does not explicitly state whether an arrest without a warrant is legal or illegal in general, but outlines rights upon arrest.", "No, it is not allowed.

All citizens have the right to freedom of speech and expression, and the right to assemble peaceably and without arms.", "The document states that no citizen shall be subject to any disability, liability, restriction, or condition regarding access to public restaurants, hotels, and places of public entertainment, or the use of public resorts maintained wholly or partly out of State funds, on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth. It also mentions throwing open Hindu religious institutions of a public character to all classes and sections of Hindus, but does not explicitly address all religious places or specific gender-based restrictions.", "The document states that all persons are equally entitled to freedom of conscience and the right to freely profess, practice, and propagate religion, subject to public order, morality, and health.

Raw response from Gemini: ["Newton defines 'quantity of motion' as the measure arising from the velocity and quantity of matter conjunctly. It is distinct from 'force' (vis insita), which is described as an innate power of resisting, by which every body endeavors to persevere in its present state of rest or uniform motion.", "Newton's three laws of motion are: (I) Every body perseveres in its state of rest or uniform motion unless compelled by impressed forces; (II) The alteration of motion is proportional to the impressed motive force and in its direction; (III) To every action there is always an equal and opposite reaction. In celestial mechanics, these laws explain how planets and comets preserve their motions in free spaces and how mutual attractions disturb their orbits.", "The document states that Newton inferred the force retaining a planet in its orbit was always directed to the sun from Kepler's first law, which it describes as the proportionality of areas to the times of their description. It also notes that if the sun were quiescent and planets did not mutually act, their orbits would be elliptic and areas exactly proportional to times by specific propositions, implying his laws support this, but does not detail the derivation process from his laws of motion and gravitation.", "Newton demonstrates that gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance by deducing this principle from the motion of the moon and Kepler's laws, specifically from Kepler's second law that planets move in ellipses with the sun at one focus. He also proves this in Proposition VIII, Theorem VIII, stating that in two mutually gravitating spheres, the weight of one towards the other is reciprocally as the square of the distance between their centers.", "Newton argues that all bodies are endowed with a principle of mutual gravitation because observations show that all bodies about the Earth gravitate towards it, the Moon gravitates towards Earth, the sea towards the Moon, and all planets mutually gravitate towards one another and comets towards the Sun. Furthermore, by Law III (action-reaction), if parts of one planet gravitate towards another, the second planet must also gravitate towards the parts of the first.", "Newton explains that the mutual actions of planets on one another cause perturbations in their orbits, though these disturbances are generally very small. He specifically notes that Jupiter and Saturn sensibly disturb each other's motions, and the Sun and Moon disturb the Earth's sea and the Earth's orbit.", "Newton used the fundamental principle of his fluxionary calculus in Principia, but its standard algorithm or notation was not published until 1693. He preferred and often censured the handling of geometrical subjects by algebraic calculations, admiring the elegant demonstrations of the ancients.", "Newton uses the concept of centripetal force to explain orbital motion by defining it as the force that draws bodies towards a center, preventing them from flying off in straight lines. He illustrates this with a stone in a sling, explaining that this force perpetually draws planets from their rectilinear paths, causing them to revolve in curvilinear orbits.", "Newton handles motion in resisting media by investigating the theory of fluid resistance, stating it arises from the fluid's tenacity, attrition, and density. He specifies that resistance from density is in a duplicate ratio of velocity, while resistance from tenacity is uniform, and that resistance of swiftly moving bodies is nearly proportional to fluid density.", "Newton distinguishes absolute time as flowing equably without external regard, while relative time is a sensible measure of duration by motion. Absolute space is inherently immovable, whereas relative space is a movable measure determined by position to bodies. This distinction supports his laws by asserting that true motion is generated or altered only by impressed forces, unlike relative motion which can change without such forces.", "The grandfather of Isaac Newton was Robert Newton.", "Yes, the document also mentions Isaac Newton's father, John Newton, and his mother, Harriet Ayscough, who was the daughter of James Ayscough."]

Raw response from Gemini: [
  "Expenses for arthritis treatment taken at home due to non-availability of hospital beds would not be covered, as arthritis is specifically excluded from domiciliary hospitalization claims.",
  "The cost of the prosthetic device implanted during surgery is payable. However, the walker and lumbar belt are generally not payable as they are considered ambulatory devices and belts/braces used post-discharge, unless the lumbar belt is for a lumbar spine surgery.",
  "The claim for dental surgery after an accident is admissible as dental treatment is covered if necessitated by an accident. For a dependent child aged 18-26 who is unemployed and unmarried, they are eligible for coverage. The claim submission requires sending the claim form with invoices, treating Medical Practitioner's prescription, and reports to the branch or head office.",
  "Intra Operative Neuro Monitoring (IONM) expenses are covered up to the limit specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance per policy period. ICU care charges are covered up to the category/limit specified in the Policy Schedule or actual expenses incurred, whichever is less.",
  "To add a newly-adopted child (3 years old) as a dependent, the application for cover must be accepted, and additional pro-rata premium received, followed by an endorsement. The insurer may refuse cover if the application is not accepted or if the child does not meet the eligibility criteria for dependents, such as being between 91 days and 18 years, or if parents are not concurrently covered.",
  "For the day care cataract procedure, the claim documents should be submitted immediately after discharge. For the 5 days of inpatient care due to complications, this would be considered a relapse if it occurs within 45 days from the discharge date of the initial hospitalization, and the claim documents for hospitalization expenses should be submitted within 15 days of discharge.",
  "Newborn babies are accepted for cover from birth if the mother is covered and maternity cover is opted, subject to written notification on or before the last day of the month following birth and receipt of agreed premium. Therefore, the newborn's intensive care expenses would be eligible for coverage under the New Born Baby Benefit Cover, provided these conditions are met.",
  "No, this is not sufficient. While a Clinical Psychologist is a recognized Mental Healthcare Professional, the policy states that treatment must be prescribed by a Medical Practitioner, and a general practitioner's prescription alone may not be sufficient for inpatient psychiatric treatment, as a psychiatrist is typically required for such conditions.",
  "ECG electrodes are payable up to 5 electrodes for every case visiting OT or ICU, and for longer ICU stays, one set every second day is payable. Sterilized gloves are payable, but unsterilized gloves are not payable.",
  "Pre-hospitalization medical expenses incurred 18 days before admission are claimable as they fall within the 'pre-defined number of days preceding hospitalization' for the same condition. Post-hospitalization diagnostics and pharmacy expenses incurred 20 days after discharge are also claimable as they fall within the 'pre-defined number of days immediately after discharge' for the same condition, provided the inpatient hospitalization claim is admissible.",
  "When a dependent child turns 27, their coverage ceases as the policy covers children up to the age of 26 years, provided they are unmarried, unemployed, and dependent. The policy states that cover ends when a dependent insured person ceases to be a dependent, unless specifically agreed for continuation until the end of the policy period.",
  "According to the Proportionate Clause (Note 1 of Clause III.A.1.A), if the room rate exceeds the policy limits, the reimbursement of all associated medical expenses incurred at the hospital, including diagnostic and specialist fees, will be effected in the same proportion as the admissible room rate bears to the actual room rate.",
  "If a claim is partly rejected due to a deficiency in documents, the company will send up to three reminders if the deficiency is not met or partially met within 10 working days of the first intimation. The insured person may represent for reconsideration of the decision within 15 days from the date of receipt of the claims decision.",
  "Yes, the claim is eligible under Day Care Treatment. This category covers medical treatment and/or surgical procedures undertaken under general or local anesthesia in a hospital/day care center in less than 24 hours due to technological advancement, which would otherwise have required hospitalization of more than 24 hours.",
  "For towns with a population of less than 1,000,000, a hospital must have at least 10 in-patient beds. In all other places (metropolitan areas), a hospital must have at least 15 in-patient beds. Both must have qualified nursing staff and medical practitioners round the clock, a fully equipped operation theatre, and maintain daily patient records.",
  "For an employer-employee group, a newly appointed employee and their newly wedded spouse can be added during the policy period. Siblings are covered up to age 26 if unmarried, unemployed, and dependent. The process requires the application for cover to be accepted, additional pro-rata premium received, and an endorsement issued by the insurer.",
  "Robotic surgeries for malignancies are covered up to the limit specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance per policy period. This coverage applies whether the procedure is performed as an in-patient or as part of day care treatment in a hospital.",
  "For air ambulance evacuation due to an accident, the insured person must immediately notify the insurer either at their call center or in writing. Emergency medical evacuations require pre-authorization, where the insurer's specialists, in association with the emergency assistance service provider, determine medical necessity before approval. The claim submission for reimbursement requires an air ambulance ticket from a registered service provider.",
  "If the insured person has continuous coverage without any break as defined under IRDAI portability norms, the waiting period for specific diseases/procedures like knee replacement surgery (other than caused by an accident) and osteoarthritis would be reduced to the extent of their prior coverage.",
  "No, the expense for an imported medication not normally used in India would likely not be covered. Medically Necessary Treatment must conform to professional standards widely accepted in international medical practice or by the medical community in India, and unproven/experimental treatment, which is not based on established medical practice in India, is excluded."

Raw response from Gemini: ["In a non-employer group policy, if a member dies, their dependents may continue to be covered until the policy's expiration at the option of the insured, as specified in the Policy Schedule.",
"For claims involving implanted devices like cardiac stents, the original invoice with payment receipt and implant stickers are required. The document does not specify how a claim would be affected if only a generic invoice without an implant sticker is provided, but it implies the sticker is a necessary part of the documentation.",
"Home nursing charges qualify for reimbursement if arranged by the hospital for a Qualified Nurse to provide expert nursing services immediately after hospital treatment, for as long as medically necessary, and if the treating Specialist recommended these services.
