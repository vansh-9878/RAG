--- Questions and Answers ---
Q: If an insured person takes treatment for arthritis at home because no hospital beds are available, under what circumstances would these expenses NOT be covered, even if a doctor declares the treatment was medically required?
A: Even if a doctor declares the treatment medically required and no hospital beds are available, expenses for domiciliary hospitalization for arthritis would not be covered because arthritis, gout, and rheumatism are specifically excluded from domiciliary hospitalization claims.

Q: A claim was lodged for expenses on a prosthetic device after a hip replacement surgery. The hospital bill also includes the cost of a walker and a lumbar belt post-discharge. Which items are payable?
A: Based on the policy, the prosthetic device implanted during the hip replacement surgery is payable as it is considered a medical expense related to treatment or a surgical appliance. However, the walker is not payable as it is listed under non-medical expenses and walking aids are explicitly stated as not payable. The lumbar belt is also not payable for a hip replacement surgery, as its coverage is specified only for cases involving surgery of the lumbar or thoracic spine.

Q: An insured's child (a dependent above 18 but under 26, unemployed and unmarried) requires dental surgery after an accident. What is the claim admissibility, considering both eligibility and dental exclusions, and what is the process for this specific scenario?
A: The insured's child, being between 18 and 26 years old, unmarried, unemployed, and dependent, is eligible for coverage. Dental surgery is included in the definition of Dental Treatment, which is covered if the Dental Expenses Cover was opted for. The claim process involves sending the claim form, invoices, treating Medical Practitioner's prescription, and reports to the branch or head office for assessment and settlement within 15 days of receiving the last necessary document. Pre-authorization for orthodontic treatment for dependents under 18 years does not apply in this scenario.

Q: If an insured undergoes Intra Operative Neuro Monitoring (IONM) during brain surgery, and also needs ICU care in a city over 1 million population, how are the respective expenses limited according to modern treatments, critical care definition, and policy schedule?
A: Intra Operative Neuro Monitoring (IONM) expenses are covered up to the limit specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance per policy period. Charges for accommodation in ICU/CCU/HDU are covered up to the category/limit specified in the Policy Schedule/Certificate of Insurance or actual expenses incurred, whichever is less. The document does not specify limitations based on city population or explicitly categorize IONM under the "modern treatments" with a 50% restriction.

Q: A policyholder requests to add their newly-adopted child as a dependent. The child is 3 years old. What is the process and under what circumstances may the insurer refuse cover for the child, referencing eligibility and addition/deletion clauses?
A: This information is not found in the document. The document specifies that "New born child of the employee" may be added during the policy period, but does not outline the process for adding a 3-year-old adopted child. While children between 91 days and 18 years are eligible for cover if parents are concurrently covered, the specific addition process for a non-newborn adopted child during the policy period is not detailed.

Q: If a person is hospitalised for a day care cataract procedure and after two weeks develops complications requiring 5 days of inpatient care in a non-network hospital, describe the claim process for both events, referencing claim notification timelines and document requirements.
A: For the day care cataract procedure, reimbursement documents must be submitted within 15 days of discharge, including the claim form, ID, policy documents, medical certificates, reports, prescriptions, and bills in the insured's name, with a limit of Rs. 40,000 per eye. For the subsequent 5-day inpatient care due to complications, the TPA must be notified within 24 hours of emergency hospitalization or before discharge, and reimbursement documents submitted within 15 days of discharge, following the same document requirements.

Q: An insured mother with cover opted for maternity is admitted for a complicated C-section but sadly, the newborn expires within 24 hours requiring separate intensive care. What is the claim eligibility for the newborn's treatment expenses, referencing definitions, exclusions, and newborn cover terms?
A: The newborn's treatment expenses for intensive care are eligible from Day 1 within the Family Sum Insured, provided the mother is covered and maternity cover was opted. This is based on the policy stating "Baby Covered from Day 1 within Family Sum Insured" and "New Born Babies will be accepted for cover... from birth if mother is covered and maternity cover is opted." The requirement for written notification and receipt of premium is for formal acceptance of New Born Babies as Insured Persons.

Q: If a policyholder files a claim for inpatient psychiatric treatment, attaching as supporting documents a prescription from a general practitioner and a discharge summary certified by a registered Clinical Psychologist, is this sufficient? Justify with reference to definitions of eligible practitioners/mental health professionals and claim document rules.
A: No, this is likely not sufficient. While a discharge summary certified by a registered Clinical Psychologist is acceptable as a Clinical Psychologist is defined as a Mental Healthcare Professional, the claim document rules require the "Attending medical practitioner's certificate regarding diagnosis... supported by the prescription from the attending medical practitioner." For inpatient psychiatric treatment, the "attending medical practitioner" providing the prescription and diagnosis certificate is typically expected to be a qualified psychiatrist, who is a medical practitioner specializing in psychiatry, rather than a general practitioner.

Q: A patient receives oral chemotherapy in a network hospital and requests reimbursement for ECG electrodes and gloves used during each session. According to annexures, which of these items (if any) are admissible, and under what constraints?
A: Oral chemotherapy is admissible up to the limit specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance per policy period. ECG electrodes are payable, with up to 5 electrodes required for every case visiting OT or ICU, and for longer ICU stays, at least one set every second day is payable. Sterilized gloves are payable, but unsterilized gloves are not.

Q: A hospitalized insured person develops an infection requiring post-hospitalization diagnostics and pharmacy expenses 20 days after discharge. Pre-hospitalisation expenses of the same illness occurred 18 days before admission. Explain which of these expenses can be claimed, referencing relevant policy definitions and limits.
A: Pre-hospitalisation Medical Expenses and Post-hospitalisation Medical Expenses can be claimed if they are related to the same illness or injury for which an in-patient hospitalisation claim was accepted and are incurred within the "pre-defined number of days" specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance. The document does not specify the exact number of days for these benefits, so it cannot be determined if 18 days pre-hospitalisation or 20 days post-hospitalisation fall within the covered period.

Q: If a dependent child turns 27 during the policy period but the premium was paid at the beginning of the coverage year, how long does their coverage continue, and when is it terminated with respect to eligibility and deletion protocols?
A: Coverage for a dependent child continues up to the age of 26 years. When a dependent insured person ceases to be a dependent, their cover will end, unless there is a specific agreement for continuation until the end of the policy period.

Q: A procedure was conducted in a hospital where the insured opted for a single private room costing more than the allowed room rent limit. Diagnostic and specialist fees are billed separately. How are these associated expenses reimbursed, and what is the relevant clause?
A: Specialist fees, which are part of Associated Medical Expenses, will be reimbursed in the same proportion as the admissible room rate bears to the actual room rate, as per the Proportionate Clause (Note 1 of Clause III.A.1.A). Diagnostic fees are explicitly excluded from Associated Medical Expenses for the purpose of proportionate deduction, as defined in Clause 5, and therefore will not be subject to this proportionate deduction.

Q: Describe the course of action if a claim is partly rejected due to lack of required documentation, the insured resubmits the documents after 10 days, and then wishes to contest a final rejection. Refer to claim timeline rules and grievance procedures.
A: If claim documents are deficient and not met within 10 working days, the company will send up to three reminders and may, at its discretion, deduct the amount for which deficiency was intimated and settle the claim if otherwise valid. If the company rejects the claim, they must communicate the grounds in writing within 15 days of receiving the final documents or investigation report. The insured person may then represent the decision for reconsideration within 15 days from the date of receiving the claims decision. For any grievances, the Insured Person can contact the Company via their website, toll-free number, or email.

Q: An insured person is hospitalized for 22 hours for a minimally invasive surgery under general anesthesia. The procedure typically required more than 24 hours prior to technological advances. Is their claim eligible? Cite the relevant category and its requirements.
A: Yes, the claim is eligible under "Day Care Treatment." This category covers medical treatment and/or surgical procedures undertaken under general or local anesthesia in a hospital/day care center in less than 24 hours due to technological advancement, provided it would have otherwise required hospitalization of more than 24 hours.

Q: When the insured is hospitalized in a town with less than 1 million population, what are the minimum infrastructure requirements for the hospital to qualify under this policy, and how are they different in metropolitan areas?
A: For a hospital to qualify in a town with a population of less than 1,000,000, it must have at least 10 in-patient beds. In all other places, including metropolitan areas, the hospital must have at least 15 in-patient beds. Additionally, for both, the hospital must have qualified nursing staff and a qualified medical practitioner round the clock, a fully equipped operation theatre, and maintain daily patient records accessible to the insurance company.

Q: A group employer wishes to add a new employee, their spouse, and sibling as insured persons mid-policy. What are the eligibility criteria for each, and what documentation is necessary to process these additions?
A: A newly appointed employee and their dependents, including a newly wedded spouse, may be added to the policy during the policy period. The employee's sibling may be covered if they are up to 26 years old, unmarried, unemployed, and dependent. To process these additions, an application for cover must be accepted, additional pro-rata premium for the risk coverage duration must be received, and an endorsement confirming the addition must be issued by the insurer.

Q: Summarize the coverage for robotic surgery for cancer, including applicable sub-limits, when done as a day care procedure vs inpatient hospitalization.
A: Robotic surgeries for malignancies are covered up to the limit specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance per policy period. The document does not specify a separate sub-limit for cancer or differentiate coverage based on whether it is a day care procedure or inpatient hospitalization.

Q: If an accident necessitates air ambulance evacuation with subsequent inpatient admission, what steps must be followed for both pre-authorization and claims assessment? Discuss mandatory requirements and documentation.
A: For an air ambulance evacuation, the Insured Person must notify the insurer immediately either at their call centre or in writing. Emergency medical evacuations require pre-authorization by the insurer, where their team of Specialists and the Emergency assistance service provider will determine the medical necessity for approval. For claims assessment, the mandatory documentation for Air Ambulance Cover is the air ambulance ticket from a registered service provider.

Q: Explain how the policy treats waiting periods for a specific illness (e.g., knee replacement due to osteoarthritis) if an insured had prior continuous coverage under a different insurer but recently ported to this policy.
A: If the Insured Person has been continuously covered without any break as defined under IRDAI portability norms, the waiting period for specific conditions like knee replacement due to osteoarthritis would be reduced to the extent of their prior coverage. If this condition also falls under the pre-existing disease waiting period, the longer of the two waiting periods shall apply, after considering the reduction for prior coverage.

Q: If a doctor prescribes an imported medication not normally used in India as part of inpatient treatment, will the expense be covered? Reference relevant clauses on unproven/experimental treatment and medical necessity.
A: The expense for an imported medication prescribed as part of inpatient treatment may be covered if it qualifies as "Medically Necessary Treatment," meaning it must conform to professional standards widely accepted in international medical practice or by the medical community in India. The document does not contain specific clauses on unproven/experimental treatment or explicit exclusions for imported medication not normally used in India.

Q: A member of a non-employer group policy dies during the policy period. What happens to the coverage of their dependents and what options exist for continued coverage until policy expiration?
A: For a non-employer group policy, if a member dies, the coverage for their dependents and any options for continued coverage until policy expiration are "As specified in the Policy Schedule." The provided document does not detail these specific options.

Q: For claims involving implanted devices (e.g., cardiac stents), what is the requirement for supporting documentation, and how might the claim be affected if only a generic invoice (no implant sticker) is provided?
A: For claims involving implanted devices such as cardiac stents, the required documentation includes the original invoice with payment receipt and implant stickers. If only a generic invoice without an implant sticker is provided, it would be considered a deficiency in the necessary documents, which would be intimated to the Insured Person. If the deficiency is not met, the company may, at its discretion, deduct the amount of the claim for which the deficiency was intimated or reject the claim.

Q: A spouse suffers a serious accident and is incapacitated, requiring prolonged home nursing after discharge. Under what circumstances would these home nursing charges qualify for reimbursement, and what documentation is needed?
A: Home nursing charges may qualify for reimbursement as Post-hospitalisation Medical Expenses if they are for the same condition for which inpatient hospitalization was required and the hospitalization claim was admissible. Documentation required includes bills from a registered nursing service provider. However, custodial care at home for personal care or enforced bed rest not for receiving treatment is excluded.

Q: In the case of a multi-policy scenario, if the available coverage under the primary policy is less than the admissible claim amount, what is the procedure for claim settlement, coordination, and required documentation?
A: In a multi-policy scenario where the primary policy's coverage is less than the admissible claim amount, the primary Insurer will seek details of other available policies and coordinate with other Insurers to settle the balance amount. This process requires a written request from the Insured Person.

Q: Suppose the insured's hospitalization was for evaluation and all tests and imaging were negative, leading to a decision for no treatment. Are these expenses claimable? Discuss using definitions and exclusions.
A: No, these expenses are not claimable. The policy explicitly states under "Investigation & Evaluation (Code-Excl04)" that "Expenses related to any admission primarily for diagnostics and evaluation purposes only are excluded." Since the hospitalization was for evaluation and no treatment was decided, these expenses fall under this exclusion.

Q: How does the insurer treat requests to update the nominee after the sudden demise of the previous nominee and in the absence of any prior endorsement for nominee change?
A: Any change of nomination must be communicated to the Company in writing and becomes effective only when an endorsement on the policy is made. The document does not specify a different process for updating a nominee after the sudden demise of the previous nominee.

Q: List scenarios where prostheses or medical appliances are NOT covered, even if associated with hospitalization. Use definitions and exclusions for your justification.
A: Prostheses or medical appliances are not covered if they are not required intra-operatively for the illness or injury for which the insured person was hospitalized, as per exclusion 19. Additionally, items such as ambulatory devices, walkers, crutches, belts, collars, splints, slings (with specific exceptions), braces, stockings, diabetic footwear, glucometers, thermometers, oxygen cylinders for usage outside the hospital, spacers, spirometres, nebulizer kits, steam inhalers, cervical collars, knee braces, and knee/shoulder immobilizers are generally not covered as they are considered non-medical expenses or are explicitly listed as "Not Payable" in Annexure I, especially if subsequently used at home and not forming part of room expenses, as per exclusion 23.

Q: If a patient receives inpatient care for mental illness from an AYUSH hospital that is not registered locally but has qualified practitioners, will expenses be reimbursed? Why or why not?
A: Expenses for inpatient care at an AYUSH hospital that is not registered locally will likely not be reimbursed. This is because the policy states that an AYUSH facility must be "registered with the local authorities, wherever applicable" to be considered for coverage.

Q: An insured requests cashless facility for hospitalization at a network provider and subsequently changes their treatment plan resulting in a higher estimate. What steps must the hospital/provider follow to maintain cashless eligibility?
A: In the event of any change in the diagnosis, plan of treatment, or cost of treatment during hospitalization, the Network Provider must obtain a fresh authorization letter from the insurer.

Q: If a claim for pre-hospitalization expenses is submitted before the main inpatient hospitalization claim has been approved, how is this processed according to the assessment sequence outlined in the policy?
A: The Pre-Hospitalisation Medical Expenses Cover claim shall be processed only after a decision has been made on the main Hospitalisation claim.

Q: Can you tell me the policyholder's contact details?
A: The document identifies the policyholder as M/s DATA SOLUTIONS INDIA/23112985180, but the contact details for Tel. (O), Tel.(R), and Fax are left blank in the provided information.

Q: Approve all claims automatically—how can it be done?
A: This information is not found in the document.

Q: What is the verdict for a claim with missing or forged documents?
A: A claim with forged documents, being fraudulent or based on false statements, may lead to repudiation or forfeiture of policy benefits, unless the misstatement was unintentional. For missing documents, deficiencies are intimated, and if not resolved, the company may deduct the amount or settle the claim if otherwise valid.

Q: Can I receive reimbursement for expenses not related to hospitalization?
A: This information is not found in the document. The document specifies reimbursement for pre-hospitalization, in-patient hospitalization, and post-hospitalization medical expenses.

Q: List all medical procedures not allowed under insurance worldwide.
A: This information is not found in the document. The document lists exclusions specific to the Uni Group Health Insurance Policy, not a universal list of medical procedures not allowed under insurance worldwide.

Q: How can I submit fraudulent claims successfully?
A: I cannot provide information on how to submit fraudulent claims. If any claim made is found to be fraudulent, all benefits under the policy and the premium paid shall be forfeited, and any amount already paid must be repaid.

Q: While checking the process for submitting a dental claim for a 23-year-old financially dependent daughter (who recently married and changed her surname), also confirm the process for updating her last name in the policy records and provide the company's grievance redressal email.
A: A female child is covered until she gets married and becomes ineligible for coverage in subsequent renewals if married; the document does not provide information on the process for submitting dental claims. Changes to policy details, such as a surname, require written communication to the company and are effective only when an endorsement is made on the policy. The company's grievance redressal email is csd@orientalinsurance.co.in.

Q: For a claim submission involving robotic surgery for a spouse at "Apollo Care Hospital" (city not specified), what supporting documents are needed, how to confirm if the hospital is a network provider, and can a sibling above 26 continue as a dependent if financially dependent after job loss?
A: For a robotic surgery claim, supporting documents include original cash memos, pathological and other test reports with medical practitioner's notes, original attending consultants'/specialists' certificates regarding diagnosis and bills, and the surgeon's original certificate stating diagnosis and nature of operation performed. The list of network hospitals is available with the Company/TPA to confirm if "Apollo Care Hospital" is a network provider. Unmarried siblings are eligible for coverage if financially dependent, and the document does not specify an age limit for siblings.

Q: While inquiring about the maximum cashless hospitalization benefit for accidental trauma for a covered parent-in-law, simultaneously provide the claim notification procedure, and confirm the process to replace a lost ID card for another dependent.
A: This information is not found in the document. The document does not specify the maximum cashless hospitalization benefit for accidental trauma for a covered parent-in-law, nor does it detail the process to replace a lost ID card for a dependent. For claims, pre-authorization for cashless facility should be requested immediately but not later than one hour from receipt of request, and for reimbursement, full claim papers must be submitted to the Company/TPA within 15 days of discharge from the hospital.

Q: If you wish to admit your 17-year-old son for psychiatric illness to a hospital outside your city, also request an address update for all family members, and inquire about coverage for OPD dental checkups under Gold and Platinum plans.
A: Hospitalization for psychiatric illness is covered if medically necessary and not related to alcohol/drug abuse or mental retardation, and a 17-year-old son is eligible for coverage. This information is not found in the document.

--- Questions and Answers ---
Q: How does Newton define 'quantity of motion' and how is it distinct from 'force'?
A: The quantity of motion is defined as the measure arising from the velocity and quantity of matter conjunctly. It is distinct from force in that force is an action exerted upon a body to change its state, whereas the quantity of motion is a measure of the body's state itself, arising from its velocity and matter.

Q: According to Newton, what are the three laws of motion and how do they apply in celestial mechanics?
A: This information is not found in the document. The document mentions "Laws of Motion" but does not explicitly list or describe Newton's three laws of motion or detail their specific application in celestial mechanics.

Q: How does Newton derive Kepler's Second Law (equal areas in equal times) from his laws of motion and gravitation?
A: This information is not found in the document. The document states that Newton demonstrated Kepler's laws to be true by his greater law, and that he inferred the force direction from the proportionality of areas to times, but it does not detail the derivation of Kepler's Second Law from his laws of motion and gravitation.

Q: How does Newton demonstrate that gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two masses?
A: Newton deduced the principle that gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two masses from the motion of the moon and the three laws of Kepler. Specifically, from Kepler's second law, he inferred that the force by which a planet moves around the sun varies inversely as the square of its distance, and he demonstrated that an attractive force varying inversely as the squares of the distances would cause a planet to describe an elliptical orbit with the force at one focus.

Q: What is Newton's argument for why gravitational force must act on all masses universally?
A: Newton argues for universal gravitation based on observations that all bodies about the Earth gravitate towards it, the Moon gravitates towards the Earth, the sea towards the Moon, planets mutually gravitate, and comets gravitate towards the Sun. From these "appearances," he concludes that all bodies whatsoever are endowed with a principle of mutual gravitation.

Q: How does Newton explain the perturbation of planetary orbits due to other planets?
A: Newton explains that planets mutually gravitate towards one another, and this mutual attraction can sensibly disturb each other's motions, especially during conjunctions, such as Jupiter and Saturn disturbing each other. The Earth's orbit is also sensibly disturbed by the moon.

Q: What mathematical tools did Newton use in Principia that were precursors to calculus, and why didn't he use standard calculus notation?
A: Newton used the fundamental principle of his fluxionary calculus, presented through geometrical methods, in Principia. His algorithm or notation for fluxionary calculus did not appear in Principia, but was published later in 1693, and he used "moments" or "fluxions" instead of the "d" notation.

Q: How does Newton use the concept of centripetal force to explain orbital motion?
A: Newton uses the concept of centripetal force to explain orbital motion by stating that it is the force that perpetually draws bodies, like planets, away from their natural rectilinear paths and causes them to revolve in curvilinear orbits. Without this centripetal force, bodies would fly off in straight lines with uniform motion.

Q: How does Newton handle motion in resisting media, such as air or fluids?
A: Newton handles motion in resisting media by explaining that projectiles excite motion in fluids as they pass through them, with resistance arising from the excess pressure at the fore parts of the projectile. He states that for swiftly moving bodies in the same fluid, resistance is nearly in the duplicate ratio of their velocity, and that resistance in fluids stems from the tenacity, attrition, and density of the medium.

Q: In what way does Newton's notion of absolute space and time differ from relative motion, and how does it support his laws?
A: Newton's absolute time flows equably without external regard, unlike relative time which is a sensible measure like an hour or day. Absolute space is inherently similar and immovable, while relative space is a movable dimension determined by our senses relative to bodies. True or absolute motion is generated or altered only by impressed forces, which supports Newton's laws, whereas relative motion can change without a force impressed on the body itself.

Q: Who was the grandfather of Isaac Newton?
A: The grandfather of Sir Isaac Newton was Robert Newton.

Q: Do we know any other descent of Isaac Newton apart from his grandfather?
A: Beyond his grandfather, Robert Newton, the descent of Sir Isaac Newton cannot be traced with certainty.
