["Newton defines quantity of motion as the measure arising from the velocity and quantity of matter conjointly. It is distinct from innate force, which is a power of resisting by which every body endeavors to persevere in its present state of rest or uniform motion.",
"Newton's first law states that every body perseveres in its state of rest or uniform motion in a right line unless compelled to change by impressed forces. His second law states that the alteration of motion is proportional to the motive force impressed and is made in the direction of that force. In celestial mechanics, planets and comets preserve their motions due to less resistance in free spaces, and the laws help determine their movements.",
"The document states that Newton inferred the force retaining a planet in its orbit was directed to the sun from Kepler's first law, which describes the proportionality of areas to the times of their description. It does not explicitly detail how Newton derived Kepler's Second Law from his own laws of motion and gravitation.",
"Newton demonstrates that gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance by showing that the weight of one sphere towards another is reciprocally as the square of the distance between their centers, assuming similar matter distribution. He also shows that bodies whose forces are reciprocally proportional to the square of their distance describe conic sections with the force center at a focus.",
"Newton argues for universal gravitation by observing that all bodies about the Earth gravitate towards it in proportion to their matter, and the moon, sea, and planets mutually gravitate. He concludes that all bodies are endowed with a principle of mutual gravitation, as the argument from appearances is stronger for universal gravitation than for impenetrability.",
"Newton explains planetary orbit perturbations by stating that the mutual actions of planets are very small and can often be neglected. However, Jupiter and Saturn sensibly disturb each other's motions when near conjunction, and the sun disturbs the moon's motion, which in turn disturbs the Earth's sea.",
"Newton used the fundamental principle of his fluxionary calculus in Principia, but its notation was not published until 1693. He preferred geometrical subjects over algebraic calculations, calling his book of Algebra 'Universal Arithmetic' and admiring the ancient's taste for demonstration.",
"Newton defines centripetal force as that by which bodies are drawn or impelled towards a center, such as gravity. He explains orbital motion by stating that this force perpetually draws planets aside from their natural rectilinear paths, causing them to revolve in curvilinear orbits.",
"Newton handles motion in resisting media by investigating the theory of fluid resistances, noting that resistance is nearly proportional to fluid density for swift bodies. He explains that fluid resistance arises from tenacity, attrition, and density, with the density-related part being in a duplicate ratio of velocity.",
"Newton distinguishes absolute time as flowing equably without regard to anything external, while relative time is a sensible measure of duration by motion. Absolute space remains similar and immovable, whereas relative space is a movable measure determined by position to bodies. True motion is generated or altered only by impressed forces, unlike relative motion, and absolute motions are determined by immovable places, supporting his laws by providing a fixed reference.",
"The grandfather of Isaac Newton was Robert Newton.",
Yes, apart from his grandfather Robert Newton, the document also mentions Isaac Newton's father, John Newton, and his mother, Harriet Ayscough, who was the daughter of James Ayscough."
