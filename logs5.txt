Answers: ["Newton defines 'quantity of motion' as the measure arising from the velocity and quantity of matter conjunctly. This is distinct from 'force' (vis insita or innate force of matter), which is defined as a power of resisting by which every body endeavors to persevere in its present state.", "Newton's three laws of motion are: I. Every body perseveres in its state of rest or uniform motion in a right line unless compelled to change by impressed forces. II. The alteration of motion is proportional to the impressed motive force and is made in the direction of that force. III. To every action there is always an equal reaction; or, the mutual actions of two bodies upon each other are always equal and directed to contrary parts. These laws apply in celestial mechanics by explaining how planets and comets preserve their motions in free spaces, and how forces generate or alter their motions.", "Newton inferred from Kepler's first law, which states the proportionality of areas to the times of their description, that the force retaining a planet in its orbit was always directed to the sun. He then demonstrated that a planet acted upon by such a force could not move in any other curve than a conic section, thus showing the truth of Kepler's laws.", "Newton demonstrates that gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two masses by showing that the weight of one sphere towards another is reciprocally as the square of the distance between their centers, assuming similar matter equi-distant from the centers. He also found that the force of gravity towards a whole planet arises from and is compounded of the forces of gravity towards all its parts, with each part's force being in reciprocal proportion to the square of the distance.", 'Newton argues for universal gravitation by observing that all bodies about the earth gravitate towards it in proportion to their matter, and similarly, the moon gravitates towards the earth, the sea towards the moon, and all planets mutually towards one another and comets towards the sun. He concludes that all bodies whatsoever are endowed with a principle of mutual gravitation, as the argument from appearances is stronger for universal gravitation than for impenetrability in celestial regions.', "Newton explains planetary orbit perturbations by stating that while planets would move in perfect ellipses if only the sun acted upon them, the mutual actions of planets on each other, though very small, do cause disturbances. For example, Jupiter and Saturn sensibly disturb each other's motions when near conjunction, and the sun disturbs the moon's motion.", "Newton used the fundamental principle of his fluxionary calculus in Principia, but its algorithm or notation was not published until 1693 in Dr. Wallis's works. He preferred handling geometrical subjects by geometrical methods rather than algebraic calculations, calling his book of Algebra 'Universal Arithmetic' in opposition to Descartes' 'Geometry'.", "Newton defines centripetal force as that by which bodies are drawn or impelled towards a point as a center. He explains orbital motion by stating that bodies in orbit endeavor to recede from their orbit's center, and it is the centripetal force that opposes this endeavor, drawing them back and retaining them in their curvilinear paths, similar to a stone whirled in a sling.", 'Newton handles motion in resisting media by stating that the resistance of bodies moving swiftly is nearly proportional to the densities of the fluids. He notes that resistance arises from the inactivity of the fluid matter, its tenacity, or friction, and that the part of resistance from density is in a duplicate ratio of velocity.', 'Newton distinguishes absolute time as flowing equably without regard to anything external, while relative time is a sensible measure of duration by motion. Absolute space remains always similar and immovable, whereas relative space is a movable dimension determined by its position to bodies. True motion is generated or altered only by impressed forces, while relative motion can change without such forces if the comparison bodies also move, supporting his laws by providing a framework for true motion independent of relative observations.', 'The grandfather of Isaac Newton was Robert Newton.', 'Beyond his grandfather, Robert Newton, the descent of Sir Isaac Newton cannot be traced with certainty, though two family traditions suggest either Scotch extraction or origin from Newton, Lancashire, before settling in Woolsthorpe.']

The company's grievance redressal email is csd@orientalinsurance.co.in.", "For robotic surgery, supporting documents include original bills, receipts, discharge certificate, doctor's consultation reports, medical history, and investigation reports.

Unmarried siblings can be covered if financially dependent, with no specific age limit mentioned for them to continue as dependents after job loss.", 'The document does not specify a maximum cashless hospitalization benefit for accidental trauma for a covered parent-in-law, only that cashless facility is available to the extent pre-authorization is approved. Immediate notice of claim with particulars like Policy Number, ID Card No., name of insured, nature of injury, and hospital details should be given to the Company/TPA by fax or e-mail within 48 hours of admission. The document does not explicitly state the process for replacing a lost ID card.', "Your 17-year-old son's psychiatric illness requiring hospitalization in a Mental Health Establishment, as advised by a Mental Health Professional, is covered.

The toll-free customer service number is 1800118485 or 011-33208485.", "For a scheduled caesarean delivery at an out-of-town hospital not on the company's approved list, cashless access will not be available, but reimbursement may be possible if the treatment is taken at a non-network hospital. Mid-term inclusion for a newborn baby is permitted upon payment of pro-rata premium. The process to change the communication email for the primary insured is not explicitly detailed, but generally, any communication to the company should be delivered in writing.", "The document lists 'Equipment’s External/durable medical/non-medical equipment’s/instruments of any kind used for diagnosis/ treatment including... ambulatory devices such as walker, crutches, belts, collars, caps, splints, slings, braces, stockings, diabetic foot-wear, glucometer, thermometer and similar related items... and any medical equipment which could be used at home subsequently' as an exclusion (4.32), implying prosthetic limb implantation is not covered. If the sum insured is exhausted, the insured person has the right to prefer claims under this policy for amounts disallowed under other policies, or choose another insurer for the balance amount if the claim exceeds a single policy's sum insured. Any change of nomination for a new legal heir must be communicated to the company in writing and will be effective only when an endorsement on the policy is made.", "Cashless psychiatric care for a dependent child is available if the treatment is in a network hospital and subject to pre-admission authorization, provided it requires hospitalization in a Mental Health Establishment as advised by a Mental Health Professional.

For a cancer diagnosis, required claim documents include original bills, receipts, discharge certificate, doctor's consultation reports, medical history, investigation reports, and histological evidence of malignancy confirmed by a pathologist.", "Air ambulance cover is available only for the Platinum Plan, up to 5% of the policy sum insured, for life-threatening medical emergencies requiring immediate and rapid transportation for conditions like accidental trauma, provided it's prescribed by a medical practitioner and the insured is in India. The document does not provide information on the process for re-issuing a lost policy document. For new dependents included mid-term, the document states midterm inclusion is permitted for newly married spouses and newborn babies on payment of pro-rata premium, but does not specify a separate waiting period for them.", 'Cataract surgery has a 2-year waiting period.
